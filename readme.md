### Intro

**[Man-Computer Symbiosis](http://worrydream.com/refs/Licklider - Man-Computer Symbiosis.pdf) by JCR Licklider**

Main takeaways: Computers should help humans in formulative thinking (by guiding us in intuitive trial-and-error process) and save time in routinized work (calculating, plotting, searching, etc). The difference in "language" and "speed" between humans and computer pose challenges in the proposed "symbiosis". These observations are still relevant in today's HCI world.

Author also discusses how computer can work with team of humans. Author proposed to develop technologies such as writing interface, wall display, natural language understanding, which are becoming mature now after half a century. To what extent these technologies are applied and to what level has the symbiosis developed requires more examination.

> *Data science is the study of extracting value from data.* “Value” is subject to the interpretation by the end user and “extracting” represents the work done in all phases of the *data life cycle*.

Generation -> Collection  -> Processing  -> Storage  -> Management  -> Analysis  -> Visualization -> Interpretation
